  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Shell escaping properly implemented using POSIX '\'' pattern. Wait prompt is hardcoded (no user input injection risk). cat > /dev/null safely discards stdin."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zero overhead for existing actions (opt-in feature). cat > /dev/null is lightweight and standard."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "POSIX-compliant wait mechanism is robust and well-tested across platforms."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with good separation of concerns, consistent styling, helpful comments, and comprehensive test coverage."
