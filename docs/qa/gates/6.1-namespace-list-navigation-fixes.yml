# Quality Gate: 6.1
schema: 1
story: "6.1"
story_title: "Namespace List Navigation Fixes"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria fully implemented with excellent test coverage (82.8%) and robust cursor centering algorithm. Implementation includes critical bug fix for large lists."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. All changes are UI/navigation related with no external input or authentication impact."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Cursor centering algorithm is O(1) complexity with minimal calculation. Viewport calculations optimized with strict bounds checking."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive bounds checking prevents cursor from going off-screen. Regression test added for 252-item list covers edge cases."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code is well-documented with clear comments explaining centering algorithm. Viewport calculation logic centralized in adjustNamespaceViewport()."
