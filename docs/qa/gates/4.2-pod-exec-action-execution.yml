nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent input validation in kubectl adapter (validateContextName, validatePodName, validateNamespaceName). Regex-based pattern matching prevents injection. No command injection vulnerabilities found."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Executor package is lightweight with minimal overhead. Pod pattern matching is O(n) which is acceptable for typical pod counts. Context box rendering is instantaneous."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages. Non-fatal errors return to TUI gracefully. tea.ExecProcess pattern ensures proper terminal state management."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns with executor package. Well-structured tests with table-driven approach. Good code documentation and clear function signatures."
